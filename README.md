# Novum-
Thesis

This project is a repository of my thesis project code, to preserve working versions of the code.
The server version is for a Mac and the base version is for an Android device.


#ErrorLog

1. CHMOD error : augmented_image_cli_osx	missing
  This error was caused by a space in one of the filepath's folders -> Dropbox (Personal)
  Using a separate working folder prevents this issue from occuring
  
2. Permissions not opening on Pixel device
  This is unresolved
  Workaround is to force target API level 25 and not the highest level
